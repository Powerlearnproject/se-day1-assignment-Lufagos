Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles ,methods and tools to the dvelopment and maintenance of high quality software systems.Software engineering plays an important role in technology as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life e.g communiction ,commerce , entertainment and health care .

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The transition from art to a structured methodology ; this brought the introduction of formalmethods which include structured development processes , planning and quality control in software creation. 
-Development of modelling approaches ;developers began using graphical models and diagrams to design and visualize system structures before coding.
-Process-Oriented Development and Agile methodologies ;led to a shift from rigid processes to flexible ,customer focused developments.The Agile manifesto led to advocating for adaptive planning ,collaboration and iterative development.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
-Design-creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
-Implementation-writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
-Testing-conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
-Deployment-releasing the software to users or customers.
-Maintenance-providing ongoing support ,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed prior to moving on to the next step while Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between cross-functional teams,requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and adaptation to change.
Waterfall is best for stable well defined projects such as banking and financial systems.
Agile methodology is ideal for fast changing ,iterative development such bas web applications.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager- oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment-a software suite that provides comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code e.g visual studio, eclipse,IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems-software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git,Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges:Changing requirements,tight deadlines,technical debt.
Strategies to overcome these challenges:Effective communication,Agile methodologies,prioritization of tasks, regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing-testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing-testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing-testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering -entails crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Importance:prompt engineering is important for guiding AI models to produce accurate and relevant outputs ,thereby enhancing their performance and reliability.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:"An engine"
Improved prompt:"A powerfull jet engine with exposed turbines,glowing hot from recent use,emitting a faint trail of smoke and heat waves."
